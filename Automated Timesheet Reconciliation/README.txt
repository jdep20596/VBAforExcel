This is a template for a timesheet reconciliation spreadsheet.

Input required: contractors timesheet details, extract from an internal booking system.

Once provided with these, it should reconcile the times, highlight discrepancies and create 
a template for a pivot which only needs to be pasted into the ERP system used.

I developed this for my current role as a way to assist my colleagues with their reconciliation tasks.
